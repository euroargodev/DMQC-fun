 DMQC-fun is a comprehensive toolbox for performing DMQC on and
 salinity calibration of core data from Argo floats. The toolbox
 provides a system for semi-automated work-flow through the stages of
 downloading reference and float data, general DMQC and preparation of
 float data for MATLAB_OWC, running of MATLAB_OWC, and production of
 updated D-files. Graphs, metadata and information from these stages
 are automaticly integrated into reports for each float.

 The toolboxes to install are:
 
 - DMQC-fun - [https://github.com/imab4bsh/DMQC-fun.git](https://github.com/imab4bsh/DMQC-fun.git)
 - matlab_owc -  [https://github.com/ArgoDMQC/matlabow.git](https://github.com/ArgoDMQC/matlabow.git)
 - evenmat - [https://github.com/evenrev1/evenmat.git](https://github.com/evenrev1/evenmat.git) 
 - m_map - [https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html)
 - GSW - http://www.teos-10.org/pubs/gsw/html/

 DMQC-fun also includes a LaTeX report template and the functions and
 scripts produce snippets of content linked into that template. You
 will need a working version of LaTeX, and for instance dviPDFm to make
 PDF reports. However, this is not necessary for DMQC-fun to be
 useful. (You might even be able to link the produced figures and text
 parts into some other word processor of choice.)

 The files and directories in this toolbox are as follows:

**Contents**	The Matlab help text for the toolbox.

**README.md**	The Github version of Contents.m.

**init_dmqc**	Both init-file and setup. Contains all installation
		and setup instructions, as well as list of your
		floats and set up for parameters that all functions
		use. Read that first! 

**work_log.txt**	Explains the whole workflow of DMQC and the use of
		this toolbox, and a good place to log your overall
		progress. Understand more there! 

**load_referencedata**	
		A script to ingest, quick-check and update the list
		of reference data for Argo DMQC and OWC. 

**check_referencedata**	
		A function to plot and check reference data
		files. Used by load_referencedata, but can also be
		used stand alone. 

**download_floats**	
		This script downloads Argo float NetCDF-files from
		the Coriolis server, as well as the altimetry
		comparison and current greylist. 

**prepare_floats**	
		Does general DMQC, including your visual checking of
		the profiles, and builds the mat-files for OWC. 

**plot_profiles**	Used by PREPARE_FLOATS to make overview plots of the
		positions and T&S data.

**inpolygon_referencedata**	
		A function used to find	reference data inside a
		lon/lat polygon. 

**operator_CPcor_new**	
		A tool for finding operator CPcor to correct for
		pressure dependent conductivity bias, using near
		float deployment ship CTD data.

**argo_sbe_CPcor**	
		A function used by OPERATOR_CPCOR_NEW to recaclulate
		salinity with new CPcor.

**run_ow_calibration**	
		Runs OWC on all selected floats.

 pair_floats_with_referencedata
		Compares float profiles to individual reference data
		profiles in the vicinity of float. Alternative when
		OWC is not possible, but also useful for any float. 

**write_D**	Produces the D-files to deliver. The last thing you do. 

**rdtime**	Translates time format in Argo reference data
		to Matlab serial days. Used by several functions.

**plot_diagnostics_ow**	
		This function is copied from the OWC toolbox and
		modified here because we felt it needed some
		improvements. It will be used instead of the original
		if you make sure the path to our version is first in 
		Matlab's path list.

**./tex/**	The LaTeX part of the toolbox. You can ignore this
		directory. It will be automaticly distributed when
		you do your initial setup (see INIT_DMQC). And
		there's a sample-DMQC-report.pdf here.

**./lib/**	The good old oceans and seawater toolboxes are
		provided here since they are not easily found
		anymore. Some other necessary tools are here as
		well. Unzip and add paths as needed.
 
**./doc/**	Contains the odd presentation etc.

**./old/**	Ignore this directory.

 The following files are only examples of how you can edit the two
 files from the OWC toolbox that you will copy to your working
 directory. But you can safely ignore this directory, and DO NOT add
 the path to it! See instructions in INIT_DMQC.

**./bak/ow_config.txt**	
		Example of how to set the OWC paths and mapping
		parameters.  

**./bak/set_calseries.m**	
		Example of how to set the OWC calibration parameters.

 Feedback is most welcome!
