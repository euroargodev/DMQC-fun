% THIS FILE IS NECESSARY FOR YOUR DMQCreport_float.tex TO COMPILE.
% THIS IS WHERE YOU WRITE YOUR NOTES WHILE ANALYSING THE RESULTS OF PREPARE_FLOATS.M AND THE OWC MAPPING AND CALIBRATION.
% BELOW ARE SOME EXAMPLE PHRASES THAT YOU CAN COMMENT, UNCOMMENT, EDIT, OR REPLACE AS YOU NEED AND WISH FOR THIS PARTICULAR FLOAT.
% IT CAN BE USEFUL TO KEEP OLD NOTES AND DATE THEM, AS YOU WILL LIKELY BE DOING MORE THAN ONE DMQC ON A FLOAT.
