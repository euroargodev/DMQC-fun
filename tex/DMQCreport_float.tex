% In this section, write a brief description of all decisions made in DMQC

% corrections with applied QC flags and errors (if applicable), cell thermal
% mass corrections (if applicable), a decision made on salinity data
% including QC flags and corrections applied to salinity data (if needed).

% For Example: "The sea surface pressure in Apex float was adjusted in
% d-mode. For cycles 1-155, the QC=1 and error 2.4 dbar was assigned to
% pressure data. Cell thermal mass correction was applied.  For cycles
% 1-155, the salty offset was detected. Correction of -0.0125 offset was
% applied, QC=1, error=0.005."

\section{Introduction}
 
%Briefly write any necessary information about the float parameters,
%location, any steps performed before the DMQC analysis, version and type
%of the reference data, DMQC software and if there any CTD data from
%deployment was used as a reference data and any additional information
%about the deployment issues.     
%\vspace{0.5cm}

This report concerns the delayed mode analysis performed for Argo-float
number~\WMOnum. For more information about this float use, for instance,
the following link:
\begin{center}
\href{url}{http://www.ifremer.fr/argoMonitoring/float/\WMOnum}.  
\end{center}
Before the analysis, real-time QC flags were visually inspected and
modified if necessary.  In addition, a few stricter tests necessary before
the salinity calibration were applied (and flags modified if necessary).
%
Then, the satellite altimeter comparison plot between the sea surface
height and dynamic height anomaly, constructed for this float by Ifremer,
was analysed.
%
Part of this analysis are plots of temperature and salinity time
series, and surface pressure. % \textbf{(if available)}.
%and plots of temperature, salinity and density plotted against the nearby
%historical CTD and Argo profiles.
                                %
%The additional plots supporting the DMQC analysis are included in the ...

% \textbf{Float~\WMOnum\ is the Apex float, where the pressure sensor is not
%   auto-corrected to zero while at the sea surface, hence the pressure data
%   was corrected during processing in delayed mode.  The procedures of
%   correction sea surface pressure are described in Argo Quality Control
%   Manual for CTD and Trajectory Data (Wong et al., 2020).}

% \textbf{The cell thermal mass corrections were applied. For SBE-41 CTDs
%   the estimated alpha was 0.0267 and tau was 18.6 s, for the estimated
%   alpha was 0.141 and tau was 6.68 s (Johnson et al., 2006).}

The salinity calibration has been performed using the configuration and objective
mapping parameters included in Section~\ref{Configuration1}.
                                %and ~\ref{Configuration2}.
The Argo float data were compared to nearby CTD and Argo profiles from the
following reference databases: \texttt{\verbatiminput{refdir}} Reference
data are distributed by Ifremer.  A simple visual check on the reference
data is done prior to analysis (see Appendix~B).

The OWC toolbox version~3.0.0 % Version number needs to be manually updated here
(\href{url}{https://github.com/ArgoDMQC/matlab\_owc}) was run to estimate
a salinity offset and a salinity drift (Cabanes et al., 2016).

Note that only ascending profiles are included in this DMQC.

Technical info on the float is given in Table~\ref{tab:techinfo} and an
overview of the float trajectory and T\&S data is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:float-info}.

\section{Quality Check of Argo Float Data}\label{DMQCpreOWC}
%
The DMQC prior to OWC is performed in four phases, after each the found
erroneous data are removed before the following phase:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Delayed-mode procedures for coordinates
\item Correction of pressure dependent conductivity bias (deep ARVOR only)
\item Visual verification of Real-time mode QC flags
\item Selected automated tests necessary for OWC
\item Visual DMQC of the variables
\end{enumerate}
The tests are described in the following subsections and all results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:rtqc}. 
\input{comments}
%
\begin{table}[!ht]
  \caption{Results for Float~\WMOnum\ in terms of number of flags for each variable, from both RTQC and DMQC.}
  \label{tab:rtqc}
  \centering
  \input{flagtable}
\end{table}     


\subsection{Delayed-mode procedures for coordinates}\label{sec:DM-coordinates}
First the coordinates JULD, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE were checked as prescribed
in Section~3.2 of Wong et al.~(2021).
%
Chronology of JULD was tested by a simple automated test and any missing
or erroneous values replaced by linear interpolation.
%
Position outliers were checked for visually in a map such as in
Figure~\ref{fig:float-info} but based on original data, and any positions
replaced by 2D linear interpolation.

\newpage
\subsection{Visual verification of Real-time mode QC flags}
In the case of RTQC flags in a profile, such profiles are compared to
temporally close profiles from same float, as well as surrounding
reference data. Each individual plot is inspected interactively in detail
and flags are removed or new flags assigned when judged necessary (to both
RTQC flagged data as well as any new findings).
%
\input{RTQCcheck} % This part is automated in LOAD_FLOATS. 
 

\subsection{Selected automated tests necessary for OWC}
In addition to RTQC, the following automated tests are necessary before 
OWC as double checks using same critera as RTQC (see Wong et al., 2021)
and in some aspects stricter based on experience in the region:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pressure increasing test / monotonically increasing pressure test in
  waters deeper than \input{MAP_P_EXCLUDE}m.
\item Double-pointed spike tests on PSAL and TEMP (see Section~\ref{sec:double-pointed-spike-test}).
\item Spike tests on PSAL and TEMP (with 0.02~PSU criterion for pressures
  greater than or equal to 500~dbar, and 0.01~PSU deeper than 1000~dbar;
  and the addition of temperature criterion 1$^\circ$C deeper than 1000~dbar).
\item Gradient test on TEMP and PSAL (declared obsolete from RTQC in 2019,
  but implemented here nevertheless).
\item Density inversion test.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The double-pointed spike test}\label{sec:double-pointed-spike-test}
The double-pointed spike tests the deviation of subsequent pairs of values
instead of single points, from the neighbouring values in a profile, as
this is not an uncommon form of spikes. The test values are formed
according to 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  TV = \left|\frac{V_{i} + V_{i+1}}{2} – \frac{V_{i-1} + V_{i+2}}{2}\right|  – \left|\frac{V_{i+2} – V_{i-1}}{2}\right| ,
\end{equation}
where $TV$ is the test value and $V_i$ are the subsequent points in a
profile. As the test values are assigned to the $i$-th point in the
profile (i.e., the upper point of the pair forming the spike), any testvalues
exceeding the criteria results in flagging of both $V_i$ and $V_{i+1}$.
%
The double-pointed spike test uses the same criteria as the single-point spike test.
It is applied before the single-point spike test, since the latter may remove
one of the values in a double-point spike and render the double-pointed spike
test useless.

\newpage
\subsection{Visual DMQC of the variables}
As prescribed in Section~3.3--3.5 of Wong et al.~(2021), PRES, TEMP, and
PSAL were checked visually by comparing to other cycles from the float
(using versions of Figures~\ref{fig:float-info} and \ref{hovmoller} from
this stage), as well as in relation to reference data in the vicinity of
the float (Figure~\ref{fig:refcomp}).  Trends in salinity in the same
reference data are also compared to float data
(Figure~\ref{fig:trendcheck}) in order to aid interpretation of the
calibration results in Section~\ref{results_CTDArgo}.
