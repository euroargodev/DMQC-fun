Float number \WMOnum\ was deployed on \input{depdate}
% centrally in the Norwegian Basin (NB) and has only moved slightly southwestwards, but is still in the deep parts of the basin.
%% Since the previous report it has moved slightly further north and has been moving around between West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) and LB.
% Hydrography is relatively invariable below 1000~m in the profiles.
% Profiles are shallow, due to shallow region.

% All profiles have been visually inspected.
% About half of the RTQC salinity flags, and all temperature flags were reversed.
% Some new salinity flags added.  
% All profiles have been visually inspected, including for temperature in the cycles with bad salinities.
% Quite a few temperature flags were reversed due to RTQC apparently simultaneously flagging both temperature and salinity.
% Visual verification of all profiles was done, resulting in only 2 new bad flags in one profile.
% Visual control of all profiles has been done, and one profile needed larger parts of its salinity flagged.
% Visual verification of in total 232 RTQC '4' flags in 7 profiles was done (T\&S), of which two had large groups of deviating salinity readings. 
% The DMQC tests resulted in 2 further bad flags, all minor individual spikes.
% No RTQC '4' flags where present, nor was any new bad flags necessary in DMQC. 
%% Further 4 RTQC flags has been verified now.
%% There were no further RTQC flags to inspect nor any new flags yielded in this DMQC.
%% Now there were no further RTQC flags to inspect, but DMQC resulted in 4 new flags.
% Note that there were many descending profiles from this float, and their salinities were all severely erratic and thus flagged bad.
% The sea surface pressure data are not displaying values below 0~dbar and there are no indications of negative pressure drift.
% The initial comparison between Argo float data and reference data, shows that temperature and salinity data are within normal values, somewhat on the warm and fresh side.
% The comparison with satellite altimeter data shows the same trends, but the float derived DHA has very little of the variability seen in altimetry data.
% The comparison with satellite altimeter data suggested no notable discrepancies.
% The comparison with satellite altimeter data shows strong coherence. (Barotropic dynamics are normally strongest over slopes.)
% The comparison with satellite altimeter data shows similar but weaker variability in the float derived DHA.
% The comparison with satellite altimeter data shows large discrepancies, but this is expected in deep waters.

% For this float the operator has determined new CPcor (within the range of the recommended) based on a near-deployment ship CTD profile.

% The OWC analysis showed no noteworthy indications of drift or offset. Hence, no correction is done.
% There is a fresh offset, which is also evident in CTD profiles near deployment (Figure~\protect\ref{fig:simple_offset}).
% However, the offset is close to or smaller than our lower limit for correction, and the float is young and in a shallow area. Hence, no correction is done. 
% The OWC analysis showed a strong negative salinity offset, and float salinity has been corrected with a $\Delta S \approx +0.01$.
% The offset is also evident in long term variability seen in the reference data (Figure~\protect\ref{fig:trendcheck}) and more recent CTD profiles near deployment (Figure~\protect\ref{fig:simple_offset}).
% The OWC analysis showed a consistent positive salinity offset through all cycles ($\Delta S \approx -0.008$).
% Reference data is somewhat old and also indicates a trend (Figure~\protect\ref{fig:trendcheck}), but more importantly it may consist of many floats uncorrected for CPcor.
% Using only CTD-reference data showed very scarce (old) availaility in the region, adn smaller offset was found by OWC, and for half of the period it was none at all (not shown).
% Based on these considerations, it is decided not to correct this float.
%
% The OWC analysis showed a negative salinity offset and trend, and float salinity has been corrected with a linear correction from the first cycle. The initial offset is confirmed by ship CTD profile near deployment (Figure~\protect\ref{fig:simple_offset}).
% The OWC analysis showed no indications of salinity drift before cycle~47, thereafter a weak drift started which suddenly developed into an extreme, unrealistic saline drift after cycle~54. This calibration was split into parts with cycles \input{calseries}\unskip. No correction is done to the first part, a linear correction is applied to the middle part, while salinity profiles in the last part are considered uncorrectable and marked as bad (qc='4') throughout.
%\textbf{Hence, this float's salinity should be greylisted.}
