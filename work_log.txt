WORK_LOG.TXT describes the workflow for core DMQC and salinity calibration, and progress log in the same file.
DMQC-fun v0.9.1; See Contents.m for file overview; init_dmqc.m for init-file and setup instructions.

0) For SETUP and FIRST TIME USE, go carefully through the instructions in INIT_DMQC.
   INIT_DMQC contains constants, paths and settings for, and will be called by, all scripts in DMQC-fun. 

1) Download and unpack reference data.
   In a shell, cd ~/Downloads/DMQC/ (i.e., your download_ref_data_dir) and lftp -u <user,password> ftp.ifremer.fr/coriolis/ to check for new datasets.
   If there are new data available, follow the instructions in LOAD_REFERENCEDATA to unpack.
   Run LOAD_REFERENCEDATA to ingest, quick-check, and update the OWC's list of reference data.
   YYYY.MM.DD: <Here you can put date stamped notes about which new reference data sets you found.>

2) In INIT_DMQC check the list of float_names and associated parameters. There is a suite of parameters for the analysis
   of each DMQC float (read the documentation inside), which you will update as you do DMQC and make your decisicions.
   Select the group of floats you want to download and work on.
   It by using INIT_DMQC that you will control all of your DMQC, including the OWC calibration.
   
3) Download float data by running DOWNLOAD_FLOATS.
   YYYY.MM.DD: <Here you can put date stamped notes about which floats you have downladed.>

4) PREPARE_FLOATS builds the mat-file(s) of the selected float(s) for OWC.
   It also tests for and uses PLOT_PROFILES to show spikes or inversions, which are set to NaN.
   When new RTQC flags are found and inspected, float parameters in INIT_DMQC must be updated and PREPARE_FLOATS re-run.
   The mat and eps files are saved in owc_data_dir (see init_dmqc.m for paths).
   The preliminary DMQC done here will also be saved for WRITE_D to write to D-files.
   Figures, text snippets of metadata, as well as whole sections for the report are also made in this process.
   YYYY.MM.DD: <Here you can put date stamped notes about which floats you have prepared.>

4b) First time doing DMQC of a Deep Arvor float, use OPERATOR_CPCOR_NEW to decide on
    a better CPcor_new to correct for pressure dependent conductivity bias.
    Needs CTD data put in a 'CTD' directory of the float's DMQC directory.
    Results and figures are put in 'CPcor' directory of the float's DMQC directory.
    Re-run PREPARE FLOATS (esp. finally)!
    YYYY.MM.DD: <Here you can put date stamped notes about which floats you have processed.>

5) RUN_OW_CALIBRATION runs on all selected floats operating inside each float's working directory (see INIT_DMQC).
   First you will have to set OW-parameters in the ow_config.txt and set_calseries.m in each float directory.
   Previous calseries_*.mat output from OWC will be deleted automatically.
   Delete the map_*.mat files manually first if you want to re-do the mapping.
   Afterwards, look through the output in the command window, and the figures in OWC float_plots directory,
   and make your notes (in notes.tex) and conclude (in discussion.tex).
   Set the decision for the float(s) in cal_action in INIT_DMQC, which allows for different actions
   for partitions of calseries in set_calseries.m.
   Re-run/iterate as many times you need.
   YYYY.MM.DD: <Here you can put date stamped notes about which floats you have processed.>

6) When you have decided it is time to use WRITE_D, which:
   Copies D and R files from download_dir's 'profiles' directory to D-files in 'Dfiles' directory.
   Applies OWC adjustments, if decided.  (Make sure you enter your decision(s) in cal_action in INIT_DMQC.)
   Updates the _ADJUSTED, _QC, _ERROR, SCIENTIFIC_CALIB_, attributes etc. in the Dfiles.
   WRITE_D also makes content for the report (7), about it's actions to the D-files.
   At this point, WRITE_D and PREPARE_FLOATS can be run independently and without RUN_OW_CALIBRATION in between.
   YYYY.MM.DD: <Here you can put date stamped notes about which floats you have finalised D-files for.>
	       
7) The report can be made automagically with LaTeX on the master file DMQCreport_float.tex
   in each float-directory. The contents made in (4-6) will be linked into the report.
   You only need too edit discussion.tex and notes.tex, and some times supplementary.tex.
   Use the report to check your conclusions. Run (4), (5), and/or (6) again as necessary, i.e., iterate (4-7).
   YYYY.MM.DD: <Here you can put date stamped notes about which floats you have reported.>
