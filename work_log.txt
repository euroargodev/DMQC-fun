DMQC-fun v0.9.

See Contents.m for file overview; init_dmqc.m for init-file and setup instructions.
Copy this file to your working directory for Argo DMQC (my_working_dir).

0) For SETUP and FIRST TIME USE, go carefully through the instructions in
   INIT_DMQC.  INIT_DMQC contains constants, paths and settings for, and
   will be called by, all scripts in DMQC-fun.

1) Download and unpack reference data.  In a shell, cd ~/Downloads/DMQC/
   (i.e., your download_ref_data_dir) and lftp -u <user,password>
   ftp.ifremer.fr/coriolis/ to check for new datasets.  If there are new
   data available, follow the instructions in LOAD_REFERENCEDATA to
   unpack.  Run LOAD_REFERENCEDATA to ingest, quick-check, and update
   OWC's list of reference data.
   dd.mm.yyyy:

2) In INIT_DMQC check the list of float_names and associated parameters.
   There is a suite of parameters for the analysis of each DMQC float
   (read the documentation inside), which you will update as you do DMQC
   and make your decisions.  Select the group of floats you want to
   download and work on.  It is by using INIT_DMQC that you will control
   all of your DMQC, including the OWC calibration.

3) Download float data by running DOWNLOAD_FLOATS. No edits needed.
   dd.mm.yyyy:

4) PREPARE_FLOATS builds the mat-file(s) of the selected float(s) for
   OWC.  It also tests for and uses PLOT_PROFILES to show spikes or
   inversions, which are set to NaN.  Select direction in INIT_DMQC, so to
   inspect ascending profiles first, and then change to descending.  When
   new RTQC flags are found and inspected, float parameters (checked &
   clustering) in INIT_DMQC must be updated and PREPARE_FLOATS re-run.
   The mat and eps files are saved in owc_data_dir (see init_dmqc.m for
   paths).  Previous DMQC is also stored in these mat files, and it needs
   to be deleted for a total reassessment of flags.  The preliminary DMQC
   done here will also be saved for WRITE_D to write to D-files.  Figures,
   text snippets of metadata, as well as whole sections for the report are
   also made in this process.
   dd.mm.yyyy:

4b) First time doing DMQC of a Deep Arvor float, use OPERATOR_CPCOR_NEW to
    decide on a better CPcor_new to correct for pressure dependent
    conductivity bias.  Also use this if you want to study the simple
    offset between ship CTD and early cycle(s) of floats.  Needs ship CTD
    data put in a 'CTD' directory of the float's DMQC directory.  Results
    and figures are put in 'CPcor' directory of the float's DMQC
    directory.  Re-run PREPARE FLOATS (esp. finally)!  dd.mm.yyyy:

5) RUN_OW_CALIBRATION runs on all selected floats operating inside each
   float's working directory (see INIT_DMQC).  You will have to
   set/recheck OW-parameters in ow_config.txt and set_calseries.m in each
   float directory.  Previous calseries_*.mat output from OWC will be
   deleted automatically.  Delete the map_*.mat files manually first if
   you want to re-do the mapping.  Note that mapping takes a while, about
   30 min per 100 cycles (on my laptop).  Afterwards, look through the
   output in the command window, and the figures in OWC float_plots
   directory, and make your notes (in notes.tex) and conclude (in
   discussion.tex).  Set the decision for the float(s) in cal_action in
   INIT_DMQC, which allows for different actions for the parts of
   calseries in set_calseries.m.  Re-run/iterate as many times as you
   need.
   dd.mm.yyyy:

5b) PAIR_FLOATS_WITH_REFERENCEDATA can be used when OWC fails, e.g., in
    shallow seas. It finds reference data near in time and space to any
    float positions, visualises and calculates simple salinity offsets
    that can be used in judging accuracy of the float salinity in areas
    where there are no deep waters and OWC calibration is not possible.
    It makes a section for the report, pointing to figures in the appendix
    that can aid the judgement. It can be run in any case, even when OWC
    works, but then it only provides the figures in appendix of the
    report. The only action is to decide that the float salinitiy is bad
    from some point (see the preamble of the script).
    dd.mm.yyyy:

6) When you have decided, it is time to use WRITE_D which: Copies D and R
   files from download_dir's 'profiles' directory to D-files in 'Dfiles'
   directory.  Applies OWC adjustments, if decided.  (Make sure you enter
   your decision(s) in cal_action in INIT_DMQC.)  Updates the _ADJUSTED,
   _QC, _ERROR, SCIENTIFIC_CALIB_, attributes etc. in the Dfiles.  WRITE_D
   also makes content for the report (7) about its actions to the D-files.
   At this point, WRITE_D and PREPARE_FLOATS can be run independently and
   without RUN_OW_CALIBRATION in between.
   dd.mm.yyyy:

7) The report can be made automagically with LaTeX on the master file
   DMQCreport_float.tex in each float-directory. The contents made in
   (4-6) will be linked into the report.  You only need to edit
   discussion.tex and notes.tex, and sometimes supplementary.tex.  Use the
   report to check your conclusions. Run (4), (5), and/or (6) again as
   necessary, i.e., iterate (4-7).
   dd.mm.yyyy:

8) Deliver D-files by putting in cloud or ftp and notify
   Christine.Coatanoan@ifremer.fr.
